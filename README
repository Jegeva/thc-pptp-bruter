PPTP brute forcer (1723/tcp)
============================

It currently only supports Microsoft Window ChapV2 authentication. This
method is used by almost all devices on the internet (including cisco).
ChapV1 support might be added later.

Microsoft implements some brute force protection by limiting the number
of possible caller_id's to 1 per second. This tool exploits some 
implementation mistake by reusing the same caller_id for multiple
authentication tries.

Performance:
============
- I got 350 passwords / second on my local network and I'm running
  at 5 - 50 passwords / second on remote networks (depending on the
  latency).


Usage:
======

cat wordlist | ./pptp_bruter [IP]

Requirements:
=============

- TCP port 1723 must be open (for requestion caller id's)
- Host must be reachable by protocol 47 (GRE)
